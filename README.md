## brokenlyre.github.io

This repo is driven by the `make github` function from the code in my [Polymathist.me repository](https://github.com/brokenlyre/Polymathist.me). I do not make any direct pushes to this repository. That is fully handled by pelican. The rendered website can be found at http://www.brokenlyre.com/.
