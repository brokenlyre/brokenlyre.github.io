        <h1><a href="./rebuilding-web-presence.html">Rebuilding My Web Presence</a></h1>
        <h1>Wayback and back again</h1>
<p>I just took a stroll through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">wayback machine</a> to get a sense at how long I've been at this from a website perspective. As far as I can tell one of main properties was stood up around 2002 where I used a cutting edge flash animation as my main navigation feature. The next major revamp after that included an archive of various doodles and a decent set of reviews regarding the cigars that I had endured. More on that some other time.</p>
<p>I didn't stop with the one site as I felt the need to maintain different levels of decorum on different properties. My mind was constantly bouncing around between a blog filled with personal rants on the universe, a site dedicated to pursuing enhanced levels of business acumen, a collaboration focused on classical music, and so on and so forth. Sites popped up around me with the hope that could regularly rotate through the media empire.</p>
<p>Alas... my focus shifted</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Oh my. I hadn't been on twitter for some time but just a quick dose helps me to realize that it's interesting to recognize your past vices and interests but that it's important to trim the fat to meet your current needs.</p>
<h2>Pelican</h2>
<p>I know that I want to create a site but I want to do it on the cheap as much as possible. A friend has been working through a Pelican static site hosted on github and I think that is going to be the best option. There are a lot of things to figure out about this.</p>
