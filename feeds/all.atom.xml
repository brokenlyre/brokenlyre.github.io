I had already mentioned &lt;a href="./rebuilding-web-presence.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that I would write about the process of rolling out this website via &lt;a href="(https://blog.getpelican.com/)"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="(https://pages.github.com/)"&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of trying to recollect how I did it for this website, I am going to go ahead a start cataloging what I do to get one of my other properties up and running. There will definitely be one thing that's a little different based on the folder structure needed within the appropriate repository on github, but I will be sure to highlight that difference and note that it will be useful for others to consider.

I had already mentioned &lt;a href="./rebuilding-web-presence.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that I would write about the process of rolling out this website via &lt;a href="(https://blog.getpelican.com/)"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="(https://pages.github.com/)"&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of trying to recollect how I did it for this website, I am going to go ahead a start cataloging what I do to get one of my other properties up and running. There will definitely be one thing that's a little different based on the folder structure needed within the appropriate repository on github, but I will be sure to highlight that difference and note that it will be useful for others to consider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I suppose that's a couple of stages down the road. First thing to realize is that Pelican is a Python solution and as such you will need a python environment. That's fairly easily accomplished by grabbing the latest distribution from &lt;a href="(https://www.anaconda.com/download/)"&gt;anaconda&lt;/a&gt;. You will also need a github account and will need to download and install &lt;a href="(https://git-scm.com/downloads)"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's where I'm going to mess things up quite a bit because it's a part that I'm not really wanting to replicate as I already have my environment installed. But I can summarize a few things that you will readily find at the &lt;a href="(https://blog.getpelican.com/)"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; reference documentation. But once Python is installed, open up the anaconda prompt and fire off the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pelican will get you running out of the gate with reStructureText but as I was simply looking for ease of typing I decided that I wanted to opt for Markdown and as such need the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As with almost any python install, It's good to ensure that you have the real latest version which may not actually be what came through pip. So...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upgrade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now you're pretty much ready to kick start a project. I navigated to an appropriate place to manage my repository for the source files for this project. In some cases you many need to make a folder and then head into it. Regardless, once you're in that base directory kick of the process with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quickstart&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to consider with the quickstart. A lot of options you can just accept as default but you absolutely need to pay attention to the deployment options. Many of the items are editable after the fact in the &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt;. Additional considerations evolve around generation and deployment through either Fabric or Make. As such there will be items that are configurable in &lt;code&gt;fabfile.py&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; respectively. I say all that to say this... please be sure to reference the &lt;a href="(http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html)"&gt;Pelican documentation&lt;/a&gt; a lot and many times over. A lot of it didn't sink in the first time through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anaconda I navigated to my project directory then made a file to house my documents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mkdir /path/to/repo-name
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /path/to/repo-name
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In git I navigated to the folder and then initialized a repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /path/to/repo-name
git init
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In github I created a repository for these source files to reside in the master branch with the intention that the published information will land in the gh-pages branch. So in my local directory I simply create a &lt;code&gt;Readme.md&lt;/code&gt; file that I will be able to push to the blank repository in github. Then I used the next commands to create a gh-pages branch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /path/to/repo-name
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages
rm .git/index
git clean -fdx
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;My GitHub Page&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; index.html
git add .
git commit -a -m &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;First pages commit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
git push origin gh-pages
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This ensures that there is a gh-pages branch to which we will publish our site documents and host the site files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to switch back to the master branch and start up pelican&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In git bash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In anaconda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quickstart&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create in root &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
if you aren't in the root directory of your repo you can point it where you need it to go.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be sure to provide an appropriate url&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the timezone thing got me the first time through. just head to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones"&gt;List of tz database time zones&lt;/a&gt; on wikipedia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I say yes to generating a Fabfile/Makefile as well as site development script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only say yes for GitHub Pages  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is where you need to consider something a little different. I am setting up a site that is NOT my username.github.io account. If this is your first ever site you may want to consider just using it, but I already have one and installing a new site so I'm going with &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; for the personal page piece. Just keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to add a couple of things. I want a &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file that will keep my published info out of my master branch as well as a couple of other files. You can just checkout the &lt;a href="https://github.com/brokenlyre/Polymathist.me"&gt;contents of the repo&lt;/a&gt; but for completeness herein this is my file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# Python-generated Files
__pycache__/
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Pelican output
output/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because of my prior experience, in my content directory, I am going to add a few folders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;extra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This will house my &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;favicon.ico&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All of the images that I might use on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is meant by pelican to store static pages that can be referenced as opposed to the blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;drafts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is just a place I store content that I'm not ready to publish but that I want included in my repository for safekeeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as file creation, the most important one that I want to deal with right away is the CNAME file. I am going to have my domain registrar point to this repo so I definitely want to be sure this file represents the expectations. It's pretty simple and you just need to change it for your needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;www.site-name.com
site-name.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To round things out and get a feel for the site when it's live, I just create a markdown file in the content folder so that the site generator has something to push. By-the-by, if you are using sublime, you can make great use of snippets to get a head start on the meta information required for the posts. Feel free to take a look at my &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/brokenlyre/ee91a3947fec759e4902808f7f811614"&gt;New Meta Post Snippet Gist&lt;/a&gt; if you care for a head start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Combing the &lt;code&gt;*conf.py&lt;/code&gt; files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get to the right place I simply copied most of my settings using the bootstrap 3 theme. I'm sure I will be taking the time at some point to change this, but it's a quick way to get things up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the makefile I made sure to put in a line for the right repository for the github pages account &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;GITHUB_PAGES_REMOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also make sure that the branch is set to gh-pages  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;GITHUB_PAGES_BRANCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;gh-pages
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;make html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;make gituhub&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;make html&lt;/code&gt; and take a gander at the output. To really check things out right, spin up a local server by running &lt;code&gt;make serve&lt;/code&gt; and then opening a browser to &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. You should be able to have a pretty solid experience before pushing this all into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to get that site into the repository. If everything is set up correctly then once you run &lt;code&gt;make github&lt;/code&gt; all of your &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; files will find their way into the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch of your repo. With that and the fact that you have an appropriate &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; file, you should be able to check the settings of the repo and notice that it's already picked up the custom domain for your use. Now you just need to be sure that the registrar has some updated settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updating the Registrar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use google domains - but in essence every domain registrar should have something similar when it comes to setting up the DNS.  You need and apex entry (or two depending how things are set up) and a www entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;NAME&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TYPE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TTL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;DATA&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;@&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1h&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192.30.252.153&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192.30.252.154&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;www&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CNAME&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1h&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;username.github.io&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if this is a project site, just put in the &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; version and don't attempt to add a directory in line. You can then head to your website url and see how fast the dns updates. In my case the updates took a couple of hours. So don't sweat it if the site doesn't load right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And..... go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this ~~gits~~ gets you to a good spot with setting up a static site. I'm sure I've missed a thing here and there. Feel free to offer a correction on my &lt;a href="https://github.com/brokenlyre/Polymathist.me/issues"&gt;issues page&lt;/a&gt; if you do see anything grossly out of order.&lt;/p&gt;

I've dealt with organizing and re-organizing and I'm sure I'll just continue dealing with it. I've tried so many different ways to stay organized that it's impossible to keep them organized! I've got too many tools that fill various gaps and I'm wondering if I can bring it all together. It's not that I'm not organized. Frankly many people around me seem to consider me to be very organized and to a certain extent I believe that I am. But it's as though I've turned into an on-and-off again collector of organizational systems. I flow in and out of them as I become more or less anxious about the things going on in my life. Analog and digital systems are all fair game when it comes to the various whims I'm feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, more than ever, I'm feeling pulled toward creating my own solution. It will likely start with a conglomeration of the various services and solutions that currently exist, but I hope that over time I can venture into a ground up amalgamation of the features I find most beneficial. Let's take a moment to run through some thoughts and practices tangential to all of this.

&lt;h2&gt;GTD - Getting Things Done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Allen's &lt;a href="http://www.gettingthingsdone.com"&gt;Getting Things Done (GTD)&lt;/a&gt; has been a constant goal post for me. It has a fairly solid place in my work environment but lacks a little bit in my personal life. I first dug really deep into it's application by adopting an email solution that my colleague &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/regishadiaris"&gt;Regis Hadiaris&lt;/a&gt; had been using and about which he had written. Once I saw the impact that this system had in my life, I yearned to move toward a mindset of &lt;em&gt;getting things done&lt;/em&gt; and, just as my intro foreshadows, I've been constantly in flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GTD in Email - ZERO INBOX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done quite a good job over the years of using GTD in email. Eventually I will write a post to go into a bit of detail about it, but it kind of goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; rules.&lt;br&gt;
That's right. No rules. At least... no rules that automatically bin emails that you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you don't need to worry about into some folders that you have set aside. Now that I've said that I can tell you that I've broken this rule to a very tiny extent. I have one rule. That rule simply checks the importance of the message (via it's flag) and sends me a text message if the message is of high importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the following folders and note the definitions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action&lt;br&gt;
These are messages upon which you need to take action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for Follow-up&lt;br&gt;
These are items for which you are awaiting someone to reply or some action in the world to take place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and Review&lt;br&gt;
These are collections of interesting articles or reference materials that you would like to read through when the time allows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive?&lt;br&gt;
Everyone is a hoarder with certain things. I'm no different. Items that I'm done with go here and are really just there for searching if something comes up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow a method&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read/Look at every email&lt;br&gt;
I said &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; rules right? So here's the moment to just realize how much you don't need rules. I'm not saying that you have to read each email in depth. If you already now the contents of the email or know that it has nothing to do with you and you're ok with things - then that's cool. But you need to have eyes on each item landing in your inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the email require your action?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you perform you action within two minutes right now?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes&lt;br&gt;
Do that thing!&lt;br&gt;
Right Now!&lt;br&gt;
Do it!&lt;br&gt;
(then delete or archive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No&lt;br&gt;
Move the item to the &lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt; folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it something you need to follow up on later?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes&lt;br&gt;
Move the item to the &lt;strong&gt;Wait for Follow-up&lt;/strong&gt; folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No
    -Is it a longer piece you'd like to read up on later?
        - Yes&lt;br&gt;
        Move the item to the &lt;strong&gt;Read and Review&lt;/strong&gt; folder
        - No&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DELETE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set and use a schedule&lt;br&gt;
The big trick here is to not think of your job as email management. Your value comes from taking action and delivering results. You need time for that. So set up a schedule where you can review your inbox a few times a day (note that I don't recommend one of those times being first thing in the day). Also set up a larger block once or twice during the week to review items in the &lt;strong&gt;Read and Review&lt;/strong&gt; folder. Finally, set up a few blocks - perhaps this is once a day - to review your &lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt; folder to be sure you're appropriately prioritized and to review your &lt;strong&gt;Wait for Follow-up&lt;/strong&gt; folder to be sure nothing is falling through a crack somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing this system, the goal for me that is obtained on the regular is to have an empty inbox. That isn't to say that there isn't any work to do. It simply means that the work is now segmented to allow for better and clearer prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tickler Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to have a set of physical folders. Forty-three folders actually. Twelve are labeled with each month of the year and thirty-one are labeled with the numbers 1 through 31 representing the days (potential days) of the month. You rotate the dates into the next month when you're done with them in the current month. The folders contain physical documents representing things that need to get done on that particular date (or month) and so it &lt;em&gt;tickles&lt;/em&gt; your mind giving you the right hints when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried tickler files once in a while but I find that the issue is that there is no really great "beautiful" place to set it up so that I can interact with it &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; have it be aesthetically pleasing. There is indeed a need for a physical element to organization. But I honestly haven't fully figure out the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other things I've tried&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nirvanahq.com"&gt;Nirvana HQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nirvana has been a good tool for organizing tasks in the GTD principles. I've used it off and on but in retrospect I've really used it more as a quick note taking system. Sometimes I group items and prioritize them, but often times it becomes a little messy and I have to go through and clean things out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
OmniFocus is a great place for lists and contexts of the lists. It does allow for planning to a certain degree. I have found myself using it mainly for grocery shopping as it does a good job maintaining context and even can alert you to consider various contexts with geofences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebrain.com/"&gt;The Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Brain is an interesting take on note taking that allows me to interconnect my thoughts. It requires a lot of meta management to make the connections. Frankly I've mostly used it as a mind mapping tool at this point and haven't really relied upon it as a notes archive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Static site generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Github, markdown, pelican - seem to be a great mashup to develop a static site and my friend &lt;a href="https://napsterinblue.github.io/notes/"&gt;Nick's method&lt;/a&gt; of combining that with a notes section seems really cool. Sometimes when I write I seem to think as if I was going to publish something and so the ease of markdown speaks to me here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/"&gt;Neo4j&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Neo4j is an interesting platform for directed graphs. I've not leveraged it en mass for true analytics but as a different method of database schema. The noun, adjective, and verb concepts help me navigate relationships in exactly the same way that I think about them. I just feel like there is something to using graph databases for thought organization which is what interested me in &lt;strong&gt;The Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With Python I am sure that I will be able to create some functions that aggregate and publish appropriate content in the ways that I see fit. It will allow me to roll some of these concepts together and even just the process of trying will likely teach me a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What am I driving for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decent place to take notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decent place to store notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to connect notes amongst each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to connect notes to capabilities or completed artifacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place to write my book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place to organize my research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place to store tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place to prioritize tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place to work on tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure that there's more to think about but I am excited to begin focusing. I hope to stand up a project repository soon so that I can plan out the features that I am wanting to develop and perhaps come up with a solution that others might enjoy. Until then... happy organizing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just took a stroll through the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/"&gt;wayback machine&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense at how long I've been at this presence thing from a website perspective. As far as I can tell I stood up one of main properties around 2002 where I used a cutting edge [ha] flash animation as my main navigation feature. The next major revamp after that included an archive of various doodles and a decent set of reviews regarding the cigars that I had endured. More on that some other time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't stop with the one site as I felt the need to maintain different levels of decorum on different properties. My mind was constantly bouncing around between a blog filled with personal rants on the universe, a site dedicated to pursuing enhanced levels of business acumen, a collaboration focused on classical music, and so on and so forth. Sites popped up around me with the hope that I could regularly rotate through my media empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas... my focus shifted

&lt;p&gt;I just took a stroll through the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/"&gt;wayback machine&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense at how long I've been at this presence thing from a website perspective.

&lt;p&gt;I didn't stop with the one site as I felt the need to maintain different levels of decorum on different properties. My mind was constantly bouncing around between a blog filled with personal rants on the universe, a site dedicated to pursuing enhanced levels of business acumen, a collaboration focused on classical music, and so on and so forth. Sites popped up around me with the hope that I could regularly rotate through my media empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas... my focus shifted
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I have things to say&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that anyone really cares. Perhaps you do or will over time. But I think I have quite a few different things to say and share about a lot of different topics. I would hope that over time, the list of tags grows and the value that one can garner from them is palpable. But in order to get there I realize that I need to regain a foothold and develop a better process around maintaining an appropriate presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my. I hadn't been on twitter for some time but just a quick dose helps me to realize that it's interesting to recognize your past vices and interests but also that it's important to trim the fat to meet your current needs. Looking at the list of those I was "following" was enlightening and I began to realize that a regular pruning is likely healthy. So I took a bit of time and scrolled through and started to remove some old accounts, many of which seemed ill-maintained anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That and some thoughtful time spent reading the feed reminded me that there is indeed some good content being shared in the twitter-verse as well as other locations. As I get deeper into things I'll have to look for the appropriate environment in which to bring all of my feeds together so that I can stay up-to-date efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I wanted to create a site but I want to do it on the cheap as much as possible. In the past, I had spent too much money for a resellers hosting account just so that I could maintain all of my properties. A friend has been working through a Pelican static site hosted on github and I think that is turning out to be the best option. There are a lot of things to figure out and tweak but the process is giving me some hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across a decent article/tutorial &lt;a href="https://appliedcaffeine.org/navbaritems.html" title="Applied Caffeine - Pelican navbar menu items"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; regarding the implementation of custom menu items in the navigation bar and that lead me to initially adopt the &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3" title="bootstrap3 on github"&gt;bootstrap3&lt;/a&gt; theme as a starting point for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;References that really helped me&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://habeebq.github.io/customizing-the-blog.html"&gt;habeebq.github.io - "Customizing the blog"&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3"&gt;bootstrap3 pelican repo "readme" on github&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/blob/master/pelican-bootstrap3/EXAMPLES.md"&gt;bootstrap3 pelican repo "Examples in the Wild" on github&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fontawesome.com/"&gt;fontawesome icon directory to know the right name&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://appliedcaffeine.org/navbaritems.html"&gt;applied caffeine - Pelican navbar menu items&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html"&gt;the entire pelican documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/wiki/Tips-n-Tricks"&gt;pelican tips and tricks wiki&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And heavily stalking these two repositories&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/NapsterInBlue/MoviesMetricsMusings"&gt;NapsterInBlue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jakevdp/jakevdp.github.io-source"&gt;jakevdp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I've got things up and running. If I get the chance I'll have to piece together my process of getting the site up and running. I had to do a lot of Googling for answers that I didn't find expressly clear in various documentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Onward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an environment in place, and a renewed energy to maintain a presence and voice my thoughts and opinions, I am truly looking forward to adding value where I can... or at least my opinion - the value of which may be in question depending on your perspective. Regardless, can't wait to have meaningful conversations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;
